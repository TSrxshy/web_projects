    <h1>Intro to Pop Art</h1>
    <h2>What is Pop Art?</h2>
    <p>Pop Art is an art movement that started around the 1950s in both the United States and United Kingdom. It involves using imagery that was more vibrant colors and a bit of irony at times. Though it is not one of the first times in art where the status quo feels like it is challenged, this movement has remained relevant even still to this day. It can be found in all forms of media, mostly seen in comic books and advertising.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>There are many prominent figures involved with this movement; Eduardo Paolozzi's collages titled <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-bunk-65447" target="_blank"> "Bunk!"</a> and Roy Lichtenstein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning_Girl" target="_blank"> "Drowning Girl"</a> just to name a few.</li>
        <li>Pop Art's influence has found it's way in architecture. It involves a more "creative freedom" incorporating bold color, unconventional designs, and sometimes vibrant art on the side of buildings.  </li>

    <h3>Andy Warhol</h3>

    <p>Born August 6th, 1928, in Pittsburg, PA, Andy Warhol is one of the more recognizable figures leading the Pop Art movement. Starting out as an commercial illustrator in New York, in Warhol's case it was mostly advertising, his unique style helped to inspire many. His studio, named The Factory, was famously known for its parties and gatherings that brought many celebrities from many different fields. This environment only helped Warhol express his freedom even more through his art and his sexuality, and while this is very important to Warhol's identity, we will be saving that for another day. Some of his more famously done works would be "Campbell's Soup Cans" and "Marilyn Diptych," where they feature Warhol's silkscreen printing technique that allowed him to reproduce images with minimal effort.  </p>
