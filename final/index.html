                <h2>About Yakuza</h2>
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>Yakuza is a game series made by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio under Sega, now with a plethora of games now going from “Yakuza 0” all the way to it’s most recent release being the ninth installment, “Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth.” These are “beat’em up,” action-packed, and adventurous games that takes you all over Japan throughout the series. You will be taking on groups, people, and even animals, that do things that will have you looking at your screen in awe. There’s more to these than just serious storyline because however serious the game is, the side content they allow is equally just as unserious as the story. One example, and a personal favorite, would be a minigame/side story where you race RC cars against little kids. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what is in store for you, hopefully I can keep this as spoiler free as possible.</p>
