                <h2>Realism</h2>
                <p>I wanted to take this time to talk about what RGG does very well, which is being able to bring the game to life. This is achieved through their use of face scanning for a lot of the cast and the maps being almost 1:1 for where you are. </p>
                <h3>Character Models</h3>
                <p>The main characters are close to their Japanese VA counterparts, like all the playable characters, a lot of the big bosses, and important figures. That’s just the tip of the iceberg, the middle section would be celebrities that appear, one that surprised me was Danny Trejo. RGG also has a deep love for wrestling so you will find Japanese wrestlers in some of the games. You would think it stops there but in some of the Yakuza games you will find cabaret clubs, a phone booth or pretty much anything that involves the use of “red light district” woman, the girls you run into are almost always the same as the girl voicing them. Personally, not something I would pay attention to too, but I appreciate the level of commitment they go through for even side content.</p>
                <h3>Cities</h3>
                <p>Over the course of the many games in this series, we are taken to many different locations, some mostly being character dependent but even still these are close to reality. The team has gone on to say that they personally go and spend time in these cities just to get a feel of the culture and to keep them pretty 1:1 to life. I’d be here all day saying all the locations but just to name a few.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kamurocho (Tokyo) – The main location that the game series starts in and is pretty much in every game moving forward. You either start here for the tutorial or in some way, shape, or form you are bound to find yourself back in the city. </li>
                    <li>Sotenbori (Osaka) – Very compact and big billboarded location, almost feels like New York, made from the real Dōtonbori area in Osaka. If you were to look at the game and real life, while most games might keep the same stuff but change the look of a logo, a lot of the signs, logos, and business locations look the same. </li>
                    <li>Okinawa – Made from the area of Kokusai Dōri and the surrounding downtown area of Naha. While the beach location, your main hub, is made by the company, it is very small compared to the city location everything else happens in.</li>
                    <li>Honolulu (Hawaii) – This is extra special because this is the first city outside of Japan for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the latest game in the series released just last year. </li>
                </ul>
